# Overview

Pet project, containing python objects and logic for a basic game of tic tac toe.

At first this will be a simple CLI application, but I want to extend it in two directions if I get the time.

First, I want to see how generalized of a game I can create. Stuff like:

    - Multiple players
    - arbitrary cols and rows
    - arbitrary winning conditions
    - multi dimensional tic tac toe
    - things like skip turns, and overriding other peoples spaces. (something like uno)
    - something like a minesweeper version.

The other direction I want to take this is into a web app. Probably with a flask backend.
